## Al-Powered Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization

**<u>Description</u>**<hr>

Develop an AI-based platform to predict crop yields using historical agricultural data, weather patterns, and soil health metrics. The system should provide actionable recommendations for farmers to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, tailored to specific crops and regional conditions.
**Expected Outcome**

A scalable software solution (web/mobile app) that helps small-scale farmers increase productivity by at least 10% through data-driven insights, with an interface supporting regional languages for accessibility.

##### <Technical Feasibility

Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., regression, neural networks) trained on open-source agricultural datasets, integrated with APIs for real-time weather and soil data.
