## Development of a Smart Digital Platform to Promote Eco &amp; Cultural Tourism in Jharkhand
**Background**<br>
Jharkhand is blessed with natural beauty, tribal culture, historical landmarks, and eco-tourism hotspots like Netarhat, Patratu, Betla National Park, Hundru Falls, and Deoghar. However, despite its vast potential, the state's tourism industry remains underdeveloped due to a lack of digital infrastructure, limited promotional outreach, low tourist awareness, and unorganized travel and hospitality services.

**Description**

Tourists often find it difficult to access reliable information about destinations, local transportation, accommodations, cultural activities, and guides. Additionally, local artisans, tribal communities, and small-scale service providers who could benefit greatly from tourism remain largely excluded from the digital ecosystem. There is a strong need for a centralized digital platform that not only improves the tourist experience through authentic and accessible information but also connects and empowers local communities, making tourism in Jharkhand more inclusive, organized, and sustainable.

**Expected Solution**

##### Design and develop an AI-powered digital tourism platform (mobile app and/or website) for Jharkhand that offers:
• AI-based personalized itinerary planning and multilingual chatbot assistance for tourists.<br>
• Blockchain-enabled secure transactions, guide verification, and digital certification for local service providers.<br>
• Interactive maps and AR/VR previews of major tourist and cultural sites.<br>
• Real-time transport and location info using geo-location.<br>
• Integrated local marketplace for tribal handicrafts, events, homestays, and ecotourism.<br>
• AI-driven feedback and sentiment analysis for continuous improvement.<br>
• Analytics dashboard for tourism officials to monitor trends and impact.
